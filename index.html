        <h3>What is an Open Data "Substrate"?</h3>

<p>The goal of this organization is to provide a forum and a place to create standards so Open Data implementors can make sure they
are building systems that can inter-operate.  This drives from a fundamental belief that “data
    is more useful” when “more people can use it”.  To help achieve that goal, we need standards and
agreements so an organization opening their data on any open data product will have the benefit of it being able to replicate
or be referenced from any other open data product. </p>

    <p>We call this a <strong>substrate</strong>, because we believe these are the required standards needed
to prevent lock-in and provide the base that higher level knowledge networks and applications can be built on top of.</p>

<p>The current challenge in the market is that we run a risk of API fragmentation, and lack of interoperability.  As more companies
    and products enter the market, we run the risk of this getting harder, not easier.  Imagine a few years down the line.
    If there are 4 different vendors and 6 open source projects.  If none of them share the same APIs or none can federate we
    go back to creating a bunch of data stove pipes, instead of an open network of data.In short, we will be making it harder for people to
    ultimately use this data, so we will be making the data less valuable.</p>

<p>We need something that looks more like an Open Data Network, rather than thousands of Open Data sites.</p>

<h3>Why Not a Traditional Standards Organization?</h3>

<p>We want everyone to get a voice, but decisions to be made as a meritocracy.  Sound like how Open Source Software works?  That's not by accident.
Many of the people working on Open Data are working in Open Source.  In addition, many don't have the money required to join traditional standards organizations.
    Here's the approach we suggest:
    <ul>
          <li>Specifications are written and stored in Git.</li>
          <li>Issues with standards can be created as issues and will be debated and resolved as software issues would be</li>
          <li>Use the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opendatastandards">Open Data Standards Google Group</a> </li>
          <li>In general, operate like an open source community.</li>
    </ul>

We're hoping this will allow the biggest number of people to help give input and direction, and that when we have a few implementations we can then go to a standards body to make this official.
